# Multiplexed imaging mass cytometry reveals distinct tumor-immune microenvironments linked to immunotherapy responses in melanoma

This github repo is for reproducing results in the paper: ["Multiplexed imaging mass cytometry reveals distinct tumor-immune microenvironments linked to immunotherapy responses in melanoma"]

Three main analyses include:
1) Single-cell segmentation was performed by [Dice-XMBD](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.721229/full)
2) IMC images protein quantification was performed by [IMCell-XMBD](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.27.461899v1)
3) Downstream analysis
